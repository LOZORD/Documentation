# UPL Coordinator Responsibilities

Each coordinator will agree to:

1. Have a door code. Without a door code, one is not a coordinator.
2. Be responsible for the lab when they're in it.
3. Attend every coordinator meeting possible.
4. Try their best to enforce the code of conduct.
5. Hold a minimum of 2 office hours a week during the semester.
  * Each office hour will be posted publicly on the upl website.
6. Work on something UPL related once a week.
  * Note: One of your office hours is a perfect time for this!
7. Make a good effort on learning the UPL internal system administration.
  * Check the documentation we have. Ask for help. No excuses.
8. Majorly contribute to at least one UPL related event per year.
  * Examples: Tech Talk, Interview Night, UPL Games, GameHax, etc.
