Welcome to the UPL!
This `man` page will help become better acquainted with the UPL and its facilities.

## Introduction

The UPL has been around since the 1980s.

[Prof. Bart Miller](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart) has been the faculty advisor since the beginning.

If you would like to know more about the UPL and its history, ask a coordinator (coord) or visit this
[project](https://github.com/UW-UPL/History).

## Ground Rules

The UPL is an open and friendly place. We do have a few ground rules that we enforce for everyone,
members and coords alike.

The basic law is __don't be a jerk__. The rules for behavior and computer usage can be found
[here](https://github.com/UW-UPL/Documentation/Code-of-Conduct.markdown).

We (UPL members and coords) expect you to follow these rules and help keep the lab a welcoming place.

## Basic Facilities

### Microwave and Refrigerator

We have a microwave and a refrigerator. You are welcome to use both. Please use them with respect and
clean up any messes you make or find.

We sometimes buy soda and put it in the fridge. Here are the rules for buying soda:

- Basic cans of soda are $0.50 (fifty cents)
- Specialty cans of soda and energy drinks are $2.00 unless otherwise marked
- Coords must either handle or observe the transaction
- No credit, IOUs, or tabs allowed!

The soda costs reflect how much we need to make to buy the soda.
__We do not sell soda for profit.__ We sell soda to buy more soda.

If you would like a particular (common) type of soda, just let us know.

### Arcade Machine (Pepade)

We have a wooden MAME cabinet that holds a computer, display, game controller and some embedded gamepads.
The computer runs an emulator. We have many classic games on the emulator.

Let us know if you want any particular games on there.

### General Lab Computers

We have eight available workstation computers. As of the writing of this manpage, all of them run Linux Mint.

To view the status of our computers, please go to the [Lab page](http://uw-upl.github.io/#/lab).
