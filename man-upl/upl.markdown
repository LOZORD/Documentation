# Undergraduate Projects Lab (UPL)

Welcome to the UPL!
This `man` page will help become better acquainted with the UPL and its facilities.

## Introduction

The UPL has been around since the 1980s.

[Prof. Bart Miller](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart) has been the faculty advisor since the beginning.

If you would like to know more about the UPL and its history, ask a coordinator (coord) or visit this
[project](https://github.com/UW-UPL/History).

## Ground Rules

The UPL is an open and friendly place. We do have a few ground rules that we enforce for everyone,
members and coords alike.

The basic law is __don't be a jerk__. The rules for behavior and computer usage can be found
[here](https://github.com/UW-UPL/Documentation/Code-of-Conduct.markdown).

We (UPL members and coords) expect you to follow these rules and help keep the lab a welcoming place.
