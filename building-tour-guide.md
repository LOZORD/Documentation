# Official UPL Building Tour Guide

The UPL gives tours of the building/department to many prospective undergraduate students that come to visit campus. Those students are usually directed here by a prof/advisor from the department to get a 'student perspective'. 

There isn't a list of things you need to say, but a nice tour generally addresses the following: (Note, it follows a sort of format that walks around the first floor, starting in UPL and walking over by 1240 to loop back around to UPL - with a stop by the CSL labs if they're interested).

## Introduction / General
- Name, hometown, year in school 
  - Ask theirs and give yours.
- Which schools (if any) are they looking at?
  - If you know a bit about those schools, give an honest comparison.
- The prospective student's interests (inside and outside of school)
  - Do they happen to know what subfield of CS they enjoy? 
- What is __your__ background (what CS classes have you taken)
- Overall UW-Madison experiences.
  - Merits of CS being in L&S vs Engineering (Like most other Unis).
- Discuss your jobs/internships/research experiences.
  - Talk about which companies recruit at UW heavily.

## UPL
- Describe the UPL.
- What we offer.
- What hardware/computers we have.
- What people work on.
- What events we do.
- Where past coords end up working (we're everywhere!).

## Main Lobby
- CS Building is actually 3 buildings glued together.
- Used to be Computer Science AND Statistics building, now just CS.
- What makes CS at Madison different from other schools.
  - Second CS department in US (maybe world?). Quite Theoretical. In L&S. 
- What you like about Madison as a city.

## CS 1240 
- Note: this room may be locked; if so just talk in the hallway assuming you won't be disturbing a class.
- Discuss intro CS classes (e.g. 301, 302, 367)
- What projects have you worked on inside and outside of class?
- Some interesting events have taken place in 1240?
  - Hackathons, Tech Talks, Etc.

## Conclusion
- Tell them to add UW Madison UPL on facebook or give them your email/link to UPL website.
- Show them the way out if they don't know, you'd be surprised how often they get lost in the building.
