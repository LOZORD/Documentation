# New User Forms

## I need to print out new user forms, how do I do that?
  * Make sure the [.md version](New_User_Signup_Form.md) is up-to-date with the [pdf version](New_User_Signup_Form.pdf).
  * If you make changes on the .md of the NUF
    * Update the Version number at the top
    * run it through [this program](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf) with the command `markdown-pdf --o PATH_WHERE_YOU_WANT_NEW_PDF_VERSION_TO_GO PATH_THAT_YOUR_MD_FILE_IS_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER`
  * Then print the .pdf version.
