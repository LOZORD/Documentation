# UPL Code of Conduct

## General Conduct

## Account Policies
The UPL was established for students to learn about computers.
While we support exploration of the system, it is important to be considerate of the other users of the system and the security needs of the UPL.
The following rules represent guidelines on appropriate and inappropriate behavior.
Violation of these rules may lead to your account being locked or deleted.

1. You may not break into other accounts, break into other computers, use UPL resources to crack passwords, or otherwise use UPL resources to subvert any established security system.
    You may not attempt to steal passwords, files, or other system or user information from these or other computers.
2. You may not delete any other user's files, or disrupt the accessibility, usability, or performance of another user's account.
    You may not harass or threaten any other user either here or at another site.
3. You may not disrupt the accessibility, usability, or performance of any UPL resources.
    Distasteful or offensive displays, printouts, or stored files are not permitted, and will be removed.
4. Passing of copyrighted material to another ("pirating") is prohibited.
    If you have an interest in testing system security, or you want to use UPL resources in a way that may disrupt performance, please contact a coordinator to make appropriate arrangements.
