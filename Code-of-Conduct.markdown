# UPL Code of Conduct
All visitors, members, and coordinators ("participants") of the UPL are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. It is enforced by UPL coordinators ("coords"). We expect cooperation from everyone to ensure a safe environment.

## General Conduct
(inspired by [The Hack Code of Conduct](http://hackcodeofconduct.org/))

### The Quick Version
The UPL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the UPL at the discretion of the coords and associated administrators.

### The Long Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to:
* Gender
* Gender identity and expression
* Age
* Sexual orientation
* Disability
* Physical appearance
* Body size
* Race
* Ethnicity
* Nationality
* Religion

And also includes: 
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking
* Following
* Photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent
* Sustained disturbance
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a [coord](http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/Coords/Coords) immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, coords and associated administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the lab.

We expect participants to follow these rules at UPL-related events.

## Account Policies
The UPL was established for students to learn about computers.
While we support exploration of the system, it is important to be considerate of the other users of the system and the security needs of the UPL.
The following rules represent guidelines on appropriate and inappropriate behavior.
Violation of these rules may lead to your account being locked or deleted.

1. You may not break into other accounts, break into other computers, use UPL resources to crack passwords, or otherwise use UPL resources to subvert any established security system.
    You may not attempt to steal passwords, files, or other system or user information from these or other computers.
2. You may not delete any other user's files, or disrupt the accessibility, usability, or performance of another user's account.
    You may not harass or threaten any other user either here or at another site.
3. You may not disrupt the accessibility, usability, or performance of any UPL resources.
    Distasteful or offensive displays, printouts, or stored files are not permitted, and will be removed.
4. Passing of copyrighted material to another ("pirating") is prohibited.
    If you have an interest in testing system security, or you want to use UPL resources in a way that may disrupt performance, please contact a coordinator to make appropriate arrangements.
5. Other prohibited activities include:
    * Cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin) mining
    * Rainbow table construction
